        <p>
          Epic crisis in the wagonian galaxy. The world is on the brink of collapse: the sales force of the Dark Empire gave one month notice before annihilating the peaceful and free planet Herokee. Gigantic rails migrations have already started, depleting the planet of all it developers. Despite all its efforts, the Coding Alliance didn't succeed yet to neutralize the threat and the clock is ticking...<br/><br/>The Alliance finest, Captain Bundle and Admiral Seaborn are now in search of a new hope to bring peace to the galaxy. An ancient myth tells the legend of the magic Dyno, an artefact that would have the ability the flatten any coding enemy into a mere string.<br/><br/>Their hopes to find this mythical object are focus on a small group of young apprentices that have been secretly, sometimes remotely, trained in the holy scripts of Ruby and Python.<br/><br/>In their attempt to consolidate freedom and build new futures for the world and themselves, they have been creating 10 sacred digital weapons and prepare themselves for battle. Will one of them find the holy Dyno? The future holds the answer.<br/><br/>The big day is about to start, the coding galaxy is about to change, forever.
